'to be shy of'  means have less than complete
There are some ways to say someone is special, carzy or a little stupid
基本思路就是比喻这个人像什么东西一样缺少了某样东西
 A few cards short of a full deck (a full deck of cards has 52 cards)
 That person is a few sandwiches of a picnic
 He is not 100% (means something is missing)
 A few beers short of 6-pack
